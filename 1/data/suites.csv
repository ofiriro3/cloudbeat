    This data driven test verifies rules and findings return by cloudbeat agent.
    In order to add new cases @pytest.mark.parameterize section shall be updated.
    Setup and teardown actions are defined in data method.
    This test creates cloudbeat agent instance, changes node resources (modes, users, groups) and verifies,
    that cloudbeat returns correct finding.
